SolAR was tested with a series of experiments, which are described in our [paper](). In order to replicate these experiments, simply download the docker files [here](). Then decide which smart contract you want to test, copy-paste the relevant smart contract(s) from the [RWContracts]() to the [BatchContracts]() directory, check whether there are any special configurations captured in a in a Preparation.txt-file ([example]()) and run ./Generate_Tests.sh.
